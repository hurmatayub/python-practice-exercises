# Python Challenges: Billing, Comparisons, Banking & More

## Overview

This repository contains multiple Python programs that explore fundamental programming concepts through real-world challenges. Each challenge demonstrates the use of different types of operators such as **arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, identity, and membership operators**.

## Challenges & Features

### 1️⃣ Arithmetic Operations in a Store's Billing System

- Users enter the prices of three items.
- Calculates the **total cost**.
- Applies a **10% discount** if the total cost exceeds \$50.
- Adds a **5% tax** to the final price.
- Demonstrates **arithmetic operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`.

### 2️⃣ Student Grade Comparison

- Takes two students' names and grades as input.
- Compares their grades and determines who has the higher score.
- Uses **comparison operators** (`>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`) to evaluate scores.
- Displays the result with a meaningful message.

### 3️⃣ Budget Management System

- Users enter their **monthly budget** and **expenses (food, entertainment, transportation)**.
- Calculates **total spending** and **remaining budget**.
- Uses **comparison operators** to warn the user if they exceed their budget.
- Helps users track their spending effectively.

### 4️⃣ Smart Home Automation System

- Simulates a smart home system using **boolean values**.
- Determines if:
  - **Lights should be ON** (if it's night or the room is dark).
  - **Doors should be locked** (if the house is empty and security is active).
  - **Alarms should be activated** (if security is active at night).
- Demonstrates **logical operators** (`or`, `and`, `not`).

### 5️⃣ Bank Account Balance Updater

- Users enter their **current balance** and perform:
  - **Deposit transactions** (only positive values allowed).
  - **Withdrawal transactions** (denied if funds are insufficient).
  - **Interest calculations** (with a valid interest rate input).
- Uses **assignment operators** (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `**=`) to update the balance dynamically.

### 6️⃣ Data Type Checker

- Demonstrates Python's **identity operators** (`is`, `is not`).
- Checks if numbers, lists, and strings refer to the same object in memory.
- Explains how Python handles object references and mutable vs. immutable data types.

### 7️⃣ Word Search Game

- Users enter a sentence and a word to search.
- Checks if the word exists in the given sentence.
- Uses **membership operators** (`in`, `not in`) to check word presence.
- Uses case-insensitive comparison for accurate results.

### 8️⃣ Basic Calculator

- Users input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation:
  - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`)
  - Floor Division (`//`), Modulus (`%`), Exponentiation (`**`)
- Demonstrates the use of **arithmetic operators**.
- Handles **division by zero** errors gracefully.

## Operators Used in These Challenges

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`
- **Comparison Operators**: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- **Logical Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`
- **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `**=`
- **Identity Operators**: `is`, `is not`
- **Membership Operators**: `in`, `not in`

## Future Enhancements

- Convert each challenge into **functions** for better modularity.
- Add **exception handling** to prevent incorrect inputs.
- Implement a **menu-driven interface** for better user interaction.
- Enhance the project with **unit tests** for better reliability.
- Improve user experience with **interactive prompts and validation**.
